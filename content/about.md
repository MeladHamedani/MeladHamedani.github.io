I'm Thomas Levesque, a French software developer from Paris. I've been programming
in C# almost since the beginning, and I still love it. I've done a lot of desktop
app development with WinForms and WPF, but nowadays my focus is mostly on ASP.NET
Core.

I'm a core maintainer of [FakeItEasy](https://fakeiteasy.github.io/), the easy mocking library for .NET. I also maintain a few personal open-source projects, which you can see on [my Github account](https://github.com/thomaslevesque).

I'm a Microsoft MVP since 2012.
